    "\n",
    "First, the user story should be in the format: As a player, I want to [goal], so that [benefit]. I'll start with \"As a player\" since that's standard for user stories. The goal is to control a bird through pipes without collision, aiming for a high score. The benefit is achieving the highest score.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, acceptance criteria. There are several aspects: Gameplay, Pipes, Scoring, Graphics and Sound, Responsiveness, Restart Option, Tech Stack, Database, Game Logic, Performance, Deployment, Additional Notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these areas, I'll list 2-3 clear criteria. For example, in Gameplay, the bird should move correctly when a key is pressed or clicked, gravity should work as intended, and collisions should end the game properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, evaluating using INVEST:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent: The game logic can be modified without affecting other parts.\n",
    "Negotiable: Some features like pipe speed might need user input for balance.\n",
    "Valuable: High scores motivate play again, so that's a plus.\n",
    "Estimable: Feasible within typical development time with existing knowledge.\n",
    "Small: It's a standalone feature added to an existing project.\n",
    "Testable: Each component can be tested individually without affecting the whole game.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think I've covered each part. Let me structure it properly.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acceptance Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gameplay:\n",
    "- The bird should move upward when the player clicks or presses a key (e.g., spacebar).\n",
    "- Gravity should pull the bird downward when no input is provided.\n",
    "- The game should end when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipes:\n",
    "- Pipes should appear at random heights and move from right to left.\n",
    "- There should be a gap between the top and bottom pipes for the bird to pass through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring:\n",
    "- The player should earn 1 point for each pipe successfully passed.\n",
    "- The score should be displayed on the screen during gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graphics and Sound:\n",
    "- The game should include simple 2D graphics with a colorful background.\n",
    "- Add sound effects for bird flapping, scoring, and game over.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Responsiveness:\n",
    "- The game should work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restart Option:\n",
    "- After the game ends, the player should have the option to restart the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Requirements:\n",
    "- Tech Stack: Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or a game development library.\n",
    "- Backend (Optional): Node.js or Flask for storing high scores.\n",
    "- Database (Optional): SQLite or Firebase for storing user data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Game Logic:\n",
    "- Implement physics for bird movement (gravity and upward thrust).\n",
    "- Randomize pipe heights and ensure consistent spacing between pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance:\n",
    "- Ensure the game runs at a consistent frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).\n",
    "- Optimize for low-latency input handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deployment:\n",
    "- Deploy the game on a web server or platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable and function names in the code.\n",
    "- Add inline comments and documentation for better maintainability.\n",
